### General info

Simple Java application implementing abstraction based on trees.

### Abstraction

Main abstract class is `Tree`.\
`Tree` has two subclasses - `ConiferousTree` and `DeciduousTree`.\
For exercise implementation purposes there were created two classes:

* `ConiferousTree` - `PineTree` and `SpruceTree`
* `DeciduousTree` - `AppleTree` and `ChestnutTree`

And also a `Main` class which includes `main()` method to present differences between mentioned implemented classes and
subclasses.
